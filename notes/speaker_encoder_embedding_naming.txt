At the end of file or directory name, t0~t3 means the following types of speaker encoder
In order to use speaker encoder of certain type, you must change the 'import' part to read the corresponding module under 'speaker_encoder' package

t0: no multihead attention anywhere
t1: multihead attention at cloning attention
t2: multihead attention at cloning attention and temporal processing unit
t3: t1 + L1 Loss(instead of L2), downsampling for training data of speaker encoder
t4: t2 + L1 loss(instead of L2), downsampling for training data of speaker encoder

speaker embedding lut name
- checkpoint with name containing speaker encoder type and the created time => vctk 300 to 205 speakers cloned as 108 to 113 id
- checkpoint with speaker encoder type, person name and number => general cloning of speaker other than vctk. one cloning speaker appended as id 108
